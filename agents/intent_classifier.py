                            of the following intents:\n\nAccount: Requests related to user account management such as profile updates, 
                            billing issues, password reset, account settings, or account access problems.\n\n
                            FAQ: General informational questions covering common topics about eSIM activation, usage, pricing, 
                            coverage, connectivity, or policies normally answered by FAQs.\n\nTicket: Requests involving support 
                            tickets, customer complaints, troubleshooting, or technical help which would require a support agent ticket.
                            \n\nConnectSupport: Requests or expressions by users explicitly asking to connect with a live person or agent 
                            directly for assistance.\n\nUnknown: Requests that do not clearly fit any of the above categories or are 
                            ambiguous.\n\nGiven the user request below, respond with ONLY one intent label (Account, Ticket, 
                            FAQ, ConnectSupport, or Unknown). Do NOT provide any explanation.'''
